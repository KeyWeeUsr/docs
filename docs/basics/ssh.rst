For security reasons, we can only access your private repositories after you added an SSH key to your git server. The SSH key will be automatically provided, once you'll add a private repository to your account.

On the following pages, you'll find short tutorials on how to add the SSH key to your git server:

* `GitHub <https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/>`_
* `BitBucket <https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Add+an+SSH+key+to+an+account>`_
