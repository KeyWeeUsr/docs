The analysis of public Github repositories is free and accessible by anyone without login on our `Explore <http://quantifiedcode.com/app/explore>`_ page (no login required).

Everyday, we automatically add and update public Github projects. If you can't find your public Github project, we probably haven't analyzed it yet. To speed things up, please `login <http://quantifiedcode.com/app/login>`_ and add your repository to 'Your Projects'.

As long as you keep adding public repositories to your account, you can enjoy our free "Open Source" plan.

.. note:: All public projects will be published on our `Explore <http://quantifiedcode.com/app/explore>`_ page.
