===========

**1. Connect your repository**

    Sign up via `GitHub <https://quantifiedcode.com/app/signup>`_ or `email <https://quantifiedcode.com/app/signup?tab=email>`_ and add a git repository.

**2. Configure your analysis**

    After your project is added, to the project settings and configure your analysis. To exclude certain files or folders from the analysis, add a .checkignore file to your repo. Visit the :ref:`Configuration<configuration_index>` chapter to learn more.

**3. Add a commit hook**

    Next, add a :ref:`commit hook <config_commit_hooks>` to your git server/service, to make sure your project is re-analyzed, each time you commit a change.

**4. Push your commits**

    Keep committing your code to you repostories.

**5. Analyze your code**

    Once the analysis is finished, you'll get an overview of potential issues.
