QuantifiedCode is an automated code review tool for Python.

How it works
------------

**1. Connect your repository**

    `Sign-up <https://quantifiedcode.com/app/signup>`_ and connect your internet-accessible Git repository (e.g,. GitHub)

**2. Configure your analysis

    After your project is added, to the project settings and configure your analysis. To exclude certain files or folders from the analysis, add a .checkignore file to your repo. Visit the <configuration> chapter to learn more.

**3. Add a commit hook

    Next, add a <config_commit_hooks>, to make sure your project is re-analyzed, each time you commit a change.

**4. Push your commits**

    Keep committing your code to you repostories.

**5. Analyze your code**

    Once the analysis is finished, you'll get an overview of potential issues.
