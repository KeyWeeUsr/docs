=============
In a nutshell
=============

QuantifiedCode is an automated code review tool for Python.

How it works
------------

**1. Connect your repository**

    `Sign-up <http://quantifiedcode.com/app#/sign-up>`_ and connect your internet-accessible Git repository (e.g,. GitHub)

**2. Push your commits**

    Keep committing your code to you repostories. After each commit, we will pull the latest version of your repository and (re-)analyze your code base.

**3. Analyze your code**

    Once the analysis is finished, you'll get an overview of potential issues,


Why we make a difference
------------------------

We took a whole new, data-driven approach to code analysis. Unlike any other code checker out there, we've conveive code error as patterns, not as rules. This is a paradigm shift indeed, but with many exciting opportunities to improve your code quality.
