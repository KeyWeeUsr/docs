QuantifiedCode is an automated, data-driven code review for Python. Our goal is to help developers write better software in less time. Therefore, we make state-of-the-art code analysis available to everyone. To achieve this, we built an engine that enables you to create your own code checks ("lints") with `Cody <http://docs.quantifiedcode.com/patterns/index.html>`_, an easy to learn pattern language. It makes the creation of code checks much easier, more intuitive and a lot faster than writing a linter. Also, describing code issues with data structures, rather than code, enables us to apply machine learning techniques reduce false positive rates. By giving this technology into your hands, we want to learn more about code quality than anyone before. Join in, analyse your code, contribute ideas for new code checks, flag false positives or let us know your ideas and feature requests. Let's improve anyone's code quality together!
