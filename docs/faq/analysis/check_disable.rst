How can I disable a code checks?
================================

Each issue class can be disabled. Either click on the "Disabled" link, next to the issue class title or got to "Settings" - "Analysis" and turn off all the check you don't like to analyze your project for.

.. note:: Disabled check also won't show up in your project badge.
