Can I add my own linter?
========================

Even better: QuantifiedCode is not only based on linters like pylint, flake8 and alike. We've created our own data-driven code checker that allows you to create your own code checks with `Cody <http://docs.quantifiedcode.com/patterns/index.html>`_. Most messages that traditional linters offer, are already on our platform. If you need more, let's say for your own project, start creating your own code checks.
