Why is QuantifiedCode free?
===========================

Our goal is to help developers write better software in less time. Therefore, we wanna make (otherwise expensive) state-of-the-art code analysis available to everyone. To achieve this, we built an engine that enables you to create your own code checks ("lints") with `Cody <http://docs.quantifiedcode.com/patterns/index.html>`_, an easy to learn pattern language. It makes the creation of code checks much easier, more intuitive and a lot faster than writing a linter. By giving this technology into your hands, we hope to learn more about code quality than anyone before. Join in, and contribute ideas for new anti-patterns, flag false positives or let us know your ideas and feature requests. Let's improve anyone's code quality together!
