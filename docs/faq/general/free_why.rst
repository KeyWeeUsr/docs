Why is QuantifiedCode free?
===========================

Our goal is to help developers write better software in less time. Therefore, we wanna make (otherwise expensive) state-of-the-art code analysis available to everyone. To achieve this, we built an engine that enables you to create your own code checks ("lints") with `'cody' <docs.quantifiedcode.com/patterns/index.html>`_, an easy to learn pattern language. It makes the creation of code checks much easier, more intuitive and a lot faster than writing a linter. By giving this technology into your hands, we hope to learn more about code quality than anyone before.
