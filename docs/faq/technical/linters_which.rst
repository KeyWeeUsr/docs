=============================
Which linters do you support?
=============================

On one-hand-side, we integrate existing linters like pylint, pyflakes, phpmd, jslint etc.

In addition, we built our own engine that enables you to create your own code checks ("lints") with `Cody <http://docs.quantifiedcode.com/patterns/index.html>`_, an easy to learn pattern language. It makes the creation of code checks much easier, more intuitive and a lot faster than writing a linter.

You'll find the full list of available Cody code patterns `here <https://www.quantifiedcode.com/app/patterns?query=generic>`_. Please contribute by adding your own code checks and sharing them back to the community.
