=============================
Which linters do you support?
=============================

Unlike other services out there, we do not build our analysis based on existing linters like pylint, pyflakes, etc.

We built our own engine that enables you to create your own code checks ("lints") with `Cody <http://docs.quantifiedcode.com/patterns/index.html>`_, an easy to learn pattern language. It makes the creation of code checks much easier, more intuitive and a lot faster than writing a linter.

You'll find the full list of available code patterns `here <https://www.quantifiedcode.com/app/patterns?query=generic>`_. Please contribute by adding your own code checks and sharing them back to the community.
