==================================
Can I disable certain code checks?
==================================

Yes. If some of our `default code checks <https://www.quantifiedcode.com/app/patterns?query=generic>`_ do not fit your needs, go to the settings of your project and click on "Code Patterns". Now, enable or disable the available patterns. WheneverÂ you re-analyze your project, disabled patterns won't be checked against your code anymore.
