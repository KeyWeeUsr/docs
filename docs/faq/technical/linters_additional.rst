========================
Can I add my own linter?
========================

Yes and no. QuantifiedCode is not based on linters like pylint, flake8 and alike. Hence, you can not add one of these linters on the platform. We've created our own data-driven code checker that allows you to create your own code checks with `cody <docs.quantifiedcode.com/patterns/index.html>`_. Most messages that traditional linters offer, are already on our platform. If you need more, let's say for your own project, start creating your own code checks.
