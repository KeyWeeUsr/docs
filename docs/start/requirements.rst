Technical requirements
======================

To work with QuantifiedCode, you need:

* Git-Server
    * QuantifiedCode works with any self-hosteed, internet-accessible `git-server <http://www.git-scm.com>`_ and with platforms like `GitHub <http://www.github.com>`_, `BitBucket <http://www.bitbucket.com>`_ and others.

* Repository access
    * For security reasons, you have to add a SSH key to your git server if you'd like to add private repositories. The SSH key will be provided by us, once you add a repository to your account.

* State of the art web browser
    * Our service works best with a state of the art web browser like Firefox, Chrome or Internet Explorer (IE 9 or newer).
