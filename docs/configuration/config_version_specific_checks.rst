.. _config_version_specific_checks:

====================================
Checks for a certain Python versions
====================================

Go to “Your projects” and click on the settings symbol. In the sidebar, click on “Basics” and tag your project (e.g,. with "python-2.7", "python-3", etc.).

With the next analysis, all patterns with the respective tag will be added to the analysis. Whenever a new pattern with the same tag is added to our platform, it will automatically be included in your analysis. Of course, after we did a quality check.

Click `here <https://www.quantifiedcode.com/app/patterns>`_, to get an overview of all available patterns and their  tags. Please note, that patterns with the tag `'generic' <https://www.quantifiedcode.com/app/patterns?query=generic>`_ will apply to Python in general and are always be applied to your analysis (:ref:`unless you turn them off manually<config_disable_checks>`).
