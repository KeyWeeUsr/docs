.. _config_checkignore:

===================================
Exclude files/folders from analysis
===================================

Just add a file named **.checkignore** to the root folder of your repo.

The syntax of **.checkignore** files is identical with the syntax of `.gitignore <http://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore>`_ files. Files and folders that are mentioned in the **.checkignore** will be ignored, once your project is re-analyzed.

The following example excludes all files and folders that are in the `test` folder. In addition, the file `demo.py` is not analyzed.

.. code-block:: text

  # .checkignore example
  # Exclude all test folders
  **/test
  # Exclude demo.py files
  demo.py
