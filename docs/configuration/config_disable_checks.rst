Code checks
===========

If some of our `default code checks <https://www.quantifiedcode.com/app/patterns?query=generic>`_ don't fit your needs, go to the settings of your project and click on "Code Patterns".

Now, enable or disable the available patterns.

Next time you re-analyze your project, disabled patterns won't be checked against your code anymore.
